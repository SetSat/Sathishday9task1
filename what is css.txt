CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written 
in HTML or XML. It controls the visual presentation of web pages, defining layout, colors, fonts, and spacing to enhance
 the user experience. CSS separates content from design, allowing web developers to create responsive and visually 
appealing websites. By applying styles to HTML elements, CSS ensures consistent and customizable design across various 
devices and screen sizes. It plays a fundamental role in web development, enabling the creation of aesthetically 
pleasing and user-friendly interfaces on the internet.
